## Definition

Missions and quests in videogames are specific objectives that the player must complete in order to achieve something in the game. These may or may not be necessary to reach the end of the game depending on which type they are and can vary widely in difficulty. 

The main missions usually take all responsability in making the main story progress, letting the player know all that's necessary for them to follow the story and acquire the skills to progress. 

On the other hand, side quests are optional tasks that the players can complete alongside the main story, and that normally rewards them for completing them with experience points, game items or other bonuses. While they are not essential to completing the videogame, they can provide additional challenges and opportunities for players to immerse themselves in the world of the game. 

There can be many types of missions and quests depending on the game's genre, story and mechanics, but here I will explain some tips you can use yo make your own.
