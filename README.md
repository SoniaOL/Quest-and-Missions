# Introduction

## Definition

Missions and quests in videogames are specific objectives that the player must complete in order to achieve something in the game. These may or may not be necessary to reach the end of the game depending on which type they are and can vary widely in difficulty. 

The main missions usually take all responsability in making the main story progress, letting the player know all that's necessary for them to follow the story and acquire the skills to progress. 

On the other hand, side quests are optional tasks that the players can complete alongside the main story, and that normally rewards them for completing them with experience points, game items or other bonuses. While they are not essential to completing the videogame, they can provide additional challenges and opportunities for players to immerse themselves in the world of the game. 

There can be many types of missions and quests depending on the game's genre, story and mechanics, but here I will explain some tips you can use yo make your own. 

# What to avoid while writing a quest 

## 1. Don't make strangers ask for favors

One thing that can make your players lose interest in a mission, is having to complete them just for the sake of continuing with the story or gaining something rather than being interested in the world. Making random NPCs in the game ask the player to do something for them without explanation or context of who is that person and give you a motive to help them, will end in the player not caring about helping or just skipping the mission if they can. 

## 2. Be careful with repetitive missions

Every mission in your game doesn't have to be a unique experience, but at least it is a good idea to make different categories of missions and add variety from them. 

## 3. Don't force the player to do useless missions just to add more time to your gameplay

If a mission is just there without adding anything special to the game, don't make the players have to do it in order to complete the main plot of the game. 

## 4. Don't make challenges too hard or too easy 

In order to keep your players motivated the difficulty of the mission must vary depending on the reward and how far into the game is the challenge. Remember to give the player all the tool that they will need in order to succeed. 

# Tips for designing quests and missions

## Using missions to immerse the player in the story 

If your game has a strong narrative focus, probably the players will want to explore the world for more lore and side stories for a better understanding of their surroundigns. Making side quests that let the player explore parts of the world that otherwise they wouldn't have visited, and get to know more about the characters in the game that they may be interested in is a good way of designing them.

One good example of this can be the loyalty missions in Mass Effect 2, in which you as the player can choose to gain the loyalty of the squad members you want, getting to know their backstory and motivations. Completing these missions not only gives you more story, but also makes the members more effective in combat and may impact on the gameâ€™s ending.

## Give challenges and prices to your players 

Some missions can be made just to give challenges to the player and, although I wouldn't recommend using this for main missions of the game that may be too much for some people, it can be a very good idea for a side quest with a satisfying reward for players that like challenges.  

A mission that does this that I like is the Colosseum of Fools in Hollow Knight, which has a series of combats that you have to win to recollect prices. None of these combats are required in order to pass the game, but it gives you items and coins that can be very useful in the game.

## Offer variety to the game

One thing that will probably cause the player to get bored of your game quickly is making the missions of your game feel repetitive and like a chore. To avoid this it is recommended adding variety and making different types of missions to the game.

An extreme example of this is the Yakuza video games, which have a lot of different activities and mini games in every corner of the map for the player to find and try, going from the normal action of the game to taking a break playing mahjong, finding a job or just singing in a karaoke.

Depending on the game it won't be necessary to reach this extreme of variety, especially having in mind that making a lot of new mechanics for every new mission is a lot of work. I would recommend that at least for the majority of missions you use the same mechanics that the player already knows, and find a way to make it a little different using narrative resources or different challenges.  
This can be seen in the mission From the Ground Up in Breath of the Wild, in which all you have to do is recollect materials and delivering them like in many other games, but what I think makes this mission more special is that you can see the progress that you are making while watching a village being slowly build up thanks to your help, and seeing more and more people living in the village and selling their products.

# Conclusions 

In order to make missions it is important not only to do it for the sake of filling the game, but to give a nice experience to the player, giving them stories, funny situations, difficult challenges and just making them feel curiosity of the world that you have created.
